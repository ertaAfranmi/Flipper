Al-Bayan is divided into 114 chapters, corresponding to the surahs of the Quran. Each chapter begins with an introduction that explains the context, theme, and structure of the surah. Then, the translation and commentary of each verse follows, highlighting the linguistic, literary, and logical aspects of the Quranic discourse. Al-Bayan also provides cross-references to other verses and surahs that are related to the topic under discussion.
 
Some of the distinctive features of Al-Bayan are:

- It uses simple and modern Urdu language that is easy to understand and relate to.
- It avoids unnecessary details and repetitions that may distract from the main message of the Quran.
- It does not rely on external sources such as hadith, tafsir, or history to interpret the Quran, but rather derives its meaning from the Quran itself.
- It does not impose any sectarian or ideological bias on the Quran, but rather respects its diversity and universality.
- It does not shy away from addressing contemporary issues and challenges that face Muslims and humanity at large.

Al-Bayan is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to study the Quran in depth and appreciate its beauty, wisdom, and guidance. It is also a useful tool for teachers, students, researchers, and scholars who want to explore the Quran from a fresh and rational perspective.
